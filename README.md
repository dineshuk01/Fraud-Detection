## 🔍 1. Project Overview

Financial fraud is rare but extremely costly. This project builds an **end-to-end fraud detection system** that:

* Detects fraudulent transactions from highly imbalanced data
* Minimizes missed frauds using recall-focused optimization
* Supports real-world scenarios with anomaly detection
* Enables decision-making using interactive dashboards

---

## 🧠 2. Business Problem

**Problem:**
Fraudulent transactions represent less than 1% of all transactions, making traditional accuracy-based models ineffective.

**Goal:**

* Maximize **fraud recall** (catch as many frauds as possible)
* Maintain acceptable false positives
* Provide interpretable outputs for business teams

---

## 📊 3. Dataset Description

**Source:** Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

**Details:**

* 284,807 transactions
* 492 fraud cases (0.17%)
* Features `V1–V28` are PCA-transformed
* `Amount`, `Time`, `Class` (Target)

**Target Variable:**

* `0` → Legitimate Transaction
* `1` → Fraudulent Transaction

---

## 🧰 4. Tech Stack

**Programming & ML**

* Python (3.9+)
* NumPy, Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
* XGBoost

**Visualization**

* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Power BI

## 🔄 6. Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Data Loading & Exploration

* Loaded raw transaction data
* Identified severe class imbalance
* Performed statistical analysis

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Fraud vs Non-Fraud distribution
* Transaction amount patterns
* Time-based fraud behavior

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing

* Standardized transaction amounts
* Removed non-informative features
* Stratified train-test split

### Step 4: Handling Class Imbalance

* Applied **SMOTE** only on training data
* Ensured no data leakage

---

## 🤖 7. Machine Learning Models

### 1️⃣ Logistic Regression (Baseline)

* Simple, interpretable benchmark

### 2️⃣ Random Forest

* Captures non-linear patterns
* Strong performance on tabular data

### 3️⃣ XGBoost (Final Model)

* Gradient boosting for high accuracy
* Handles imbalance using `scale_pos_weight`
* Best recall–precision tradeoff

### 4️⃣ Isolation Forest (Unsupervised)

* Detects anomalies when labels are unavailable
* Industry-relevant for real fraud systems

---

## 🎯 8. Threshold Tuning Strategy

**Why Threshold Tuning?**

* Default probability threshold (0.5) misses frauds
* Fraud detection prioritizes **recall over precision**

**Approach:**

* Generated Precision–Recall curve
* Analyzed Recall vs Threshold graph
* Selected lower threshold (e.g. 0.2) to maximize recall

**Business Impact:**

* Fewer missed frauds
* Acceptable increase in false alerts

---

## 📐 9. Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy is misleading for imbalanced data.

**Used Metrics:**

* Recall (Primary)
* Precision
* ROC-AUC Score
* Confusion Matrix

---

## 📈 10. Key Visualizations (Graphs)

The following graphs were generated in Jupyter Notebook:

1️⃣ **Class Imbalance Plot**
Shows extreme imbalance between fraud and legitimate transactions

2️⃣ **Transaction Amount Distribution**
Helps identify unusual spending behavior

3️⃣ **Precision–Recall Curve**
Visualizes tradeoff between catching frauds and false alarms

4️⃣ **Recall vs Threshold Curve**
Used to select business-optimal probability threshold

5️⃣ **Feature Importance (XGBoost)**
Explains which transaction patterns influence fraud detection

---

## 📊 11. Power BI Dashboard

**Dashboard Capabilities:**

* Fraud rate & total fraud amount (KPIs)
* Fraud probability distribution
* Detected vs missed fraud analysis
* Transaction-level drill-down
* Risk-based filtering

**Audience:**

* Fraud analysts
* Risk management teams
* Business stakeholders
